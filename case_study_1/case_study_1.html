      <div id="Context" class="context">
        <h1>Context</h1>
        <p>Over the course of 3 months, a talented group of myself and 4 others went
            through a UX process to reserach, wireframe, usability test, and
            present an application called UWhiskers. A tool for users to connect with
            each other through a mutual love of food.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="Problem" class="problem">
        <h1>Problem</h1>
        <p>We aimed to address the lack of community involvement pertaining to the
            Stratford School of Interaction and
            Design. We decided to tackle two other
            issues: the lack of options to help students connect with each other, and the
            general lack of knowledge many students have about food and eating.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="Vision-Statement" class="vision-statement">
        <h1>Vision Statement</h1>
        <p>Our Application will help to improve students ability to cook their own
            meals by creating an environment where they can interact and share
            their life through the food they enjoy.
            <br /> <br />

            The solution we designed is a hybrid between an Instagram-like sharing
            service, but specifically for food and resturants, as well as a facebook-like environment
            for creating events and communicating with one another. Students can share
            their recipes while others interact with posts; as well as creating
            events, posting about good resturants, and reccomending tips about how
            to cook better.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="Research" class="research">
        <h1>Research</h1>
        <p>Having students at the Stratford School of Interaction and Design (SSID) be our target audience,
            we focused our research on two major areas: an analysis of the ecosystem around
            SSID, and interviews/surveys of the students attending SSID. Each member of our group
            individually conducted research around the ecosystem. We conducted
            demographic surveys of the students, researched the campus that the
            students attend,  and the envirnoment/resources that the city of Stratford
            has as whole. Diving in deeper I interviewed a few students about their
            motivations, pain points, and perspective about the issue surrounding the student community more deeply.
            Below is my accumulation of research given by an ecosystem report.</p>
            <a href="images/ecosystem-report.pdf" target="_blank"><button class="ecosystem-link" type="button" name="button">Ecosystem Analysis</button></a>
            <br /><br />
            <p>From here we discussed and evaluated what our primary users goals,
                motivations, pain points, common traits, etc were. We then used these ideas of our general user to conduct additional
                research to better understand some of the
                extreme needs of our users. We took all the information we gathered and
                developed user personas, One of which is shown below. </p>
                <img class="persona" src="images/persona.png" alt="" />   <br />  <br />
                <p>Our personas helped us round out who we were designing for. We found that
                    because most students live far from the campus and are very career oriented,
                    they have little time to prepare meals. So, we knew we needed to design an
                    experience that helped students cook and learn efficiently, while having fun along the way. In order to do that
                    we created and experience map.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="Experience-Map" class="experience-map">
        <h1>Experience Map</h1>
        <p>We wanted our experience map to be a clear, informative, and be a
            creatively engaging map of a students timeline accross one semester. We
            outlined the mood, main concerns, and more about how a student would
            feel at certain points of the semester. We themed our map comewhat like
            a cake menu, as our main theme for our app surrounds food. The experience
            map can be seen below.</p>
            <img class="xmap" src="images/TeamUranus_xmap.png" alt="">
      </div>
      <div id="Designs" class="designs">
        <h1>Designs</h1>
        <p>Once all our research and planning was finished we moved on to creating
            designs, sketches and mockups. Our first priority was to brainstorm and figure
            out what the general layout of our app was going to be. We decided to go with
            a mobile app, as we understood it would be more covenient for our users, and we
            started sketching. We figured a good way to go about structuring our
            preliminary prototype was to each create our own sketches and then come
            together to compare what we liked and what we didn’t. Below are some of
            our initial mockups and wireframes.</p>
            <img class="wireframe-1"src="images/wireframe_2.jpg" alt="">
            <img class="wireframe-2"src="images/wireframe_1.jpg" alt="">
            <p>We figured we wanted our app to have three main aspects to it; an ability to
               post and maintain your own profile, an ability to share and interact with
              others, and an ability to compile a personal recipe book to store your favourite
              recipes and create meal plans. once we had a final paper prototype complete,
              we wanted evaluate how functional it actually was. So, we conducted some
              usability testing. Through testing we discovered that all of our main
              components made sense but, the site flow and what certain interactions
              did were somewhat confusing. Due to this we decided our hot bar would
              be well labelled and have only ‘one away’ interactions, meaning that to get
              to a certain page, such as the recipe book, it would only take one interaction
              of the hot bar to take you there. Anything else we deemed less important but
              still necessary we put into a hamburger menu, accesable from any page.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="Prototype" class="prototyping">
        <h1>Prototyping</h1>
        <p>We had a solid concept of what we wanted our app to be and how it would
            function so we began prototyping our concepts. Using Figma we were able
            to all work on creating the prototyping at the same time but on our own
            schedule. However, we quickly ran into a road block. At this point we didn’t
            have a logo or even a solid brand or name for our app so it was really difficult
             to create a cohesive prototype. We decided to brainstorm
            much like we did with our initial sketching. We had a meeting and decided
            on the name ‘UWhiskers’ as the campus it was for was a UWaterloo campus,
            and ‘whiskers’ being a play on both a kitchen utensil and the classic movie
            ‘Ratatouille’. From here we all created a logo design on our own,
            coming back for a second meeting to discuss and create a final logo. Below
            are some of the ideas.</p>
            <img class="mock-logos" src="images/Logos.png" alt="" />
            <p>We ended up having little to discuss because we all loved the logo one of the
                group members, Brendan, created. We all decided that we would go with
                Brendan’s idea for the logo (located as the middle image above) and from there
                worked on colour ideas. We established that an orange would be our main
                colour as it seemed to fit our theme nicely. Below is our final logo.</p>
            <img class="uwhiskers-logo" src="images/uwhiskers.png" alt="" />
            <p>Once he had a general idea of branding we were able to effectively put
                    together a first prototype using Figma. We created user flows, error screens,
                    log in/sign up screens, etc. Since we were using Figma we all contributed to
                    making the UI of the prototype. However, I mainly contributed by creating the
                    general flow, orginizing how many frames we needed, and how it was to be
                    laid out, as well as editing; overall I ensured the big picture made sense and
                    everything was cohesive. Below is out initial prototype.</p>
                <img class="low-fidelity-mockup" src="images/prototype_1.png" alt="" />
                <p>From here we did some more user testing, which gave us the information we
                    needed to make our final tweaks. We created a more fleshed out prototype;
                    adding colour, tweaking designs, and adding more user flows to illustrate
                    different interactions. With the final prototype completed we creatd a
                    PowerPoint and gave a presentation about what our app accomplished and
                    how it accomplished those goals. </p>

      </div>
      <div id="Takeaways" class="takeaways">
        <h1>Takeaways</h1>
        <p>I learned a lot through this project; especially about the UX design proccess. I think my most important takeaway is about planning.
            Throughout the execuion of our design I found myself thinking ‘I wish we had more information’. While we had conducted research,
            it wasn’t necessarily enough, and it definitely wasn’t the best quality. If I were to do this project again I think the biggest thing I would
            change is figuring out what to research before diving in. We had  a lot of data but most of it was didn't help our design because we asked the wrong
            kinds of questions and read the wrong articles. So, in future I know to ensure to have a lot of good quality research before beginning
            the design phase. </br></br>

            Another thing I realized is that my graphic design skills were below par when  compared to my peers.... atleast I felt like they were.
            While I think this is okay, there were many other ways where I was able to contribute, I will be working to improve those technical skills
            for future projects. </br></br>

            Although there were areas I found needed improvement, one thing I felt I really excelled at and gave a lot of value to the team were
            in my leadership capabilities. Since this was a class project and no specific roles were delegated, we were all equal and contributing to
            each element of the process. More often than not I found myself taking on more of the Project Manager type role; facilitating
            discussion, ensuring decisions got made, keeping everyone accountable to deadline, and keeping track of the ‘big picture’ to ensure
            everything was cohesive, are all examples of what I excelled at during this project.</p>
